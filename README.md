# Mining Industry AI Model for Predicting Silica Concentrate Percentage

## Introduction
In this project, we develop machine learning and deep learning models to predict the percentage of Silica Concentrate in the Iron ore concentrate per minute. This project aims to provide a faster and more efficient method compared to traditional lab measurements in the Mining Industry.

## Problem Statement
The traditional method of measuring the percentage of Silica Concentrate involves lab measurements, which can be time-consuming and inefficient for real-time decision making. Our goal is to predict the Silica Concentrate percentage accurately and quickly to enhance operational efficiency in mining facilities.

## Objective
Predict the percentage of Silica Concentrate in the Iron ore concentrate per minute using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

## Getting Started
- Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:DevanshL/Mine_Quality.git`
- Access the dataset from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/19dRMuuGBtguy2JAtmF7JxEE2Mnq241iy)

## Models Used
1. Linear Regression
2. Decision Tree Regressor
3. Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
4. XGBoost Regressor


## Model Evaluation and Performance
We evaluated the models using a variety of metrics to gauge their effectiveness in predicting silica concentrate percentage. The metrics considered include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (RÂ²). These metrics provide insight into the accuracy, precision, and goodness-of-fit of each model.

## Insights from Model Evaluation
Upon evaluating the models, several key insights emerged:
- While linear regression provides a baseline performance, it may struggle to capture complex relationships in the data.
- Decision Tree Regressor exhibits strong interpretability but may suffer from overfitting, particularly with complex datasets.
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN) offers flexibility and can capture intricate patterns in the data but requires careful tuning to prevent overfitting.
- XGBoost Regressor, known for its ensemble learning capabilities, demonstrates robust performance and can handle large datasets effectively.

## Discussion and Recommendations
Based on the model evaluation, the Decision Tree Regressor emerges as a viable option due to its interpretability and competitive performance metrics. However, to enhance predictive accuracy further, ensemble methods like XGBoost Regressor could be explored. Additionally, fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the ANN model might unlock its full potential. Overall, a combination of these models or an ensemble approach could provide the most reliable predictions for silica concentrate percentage.

## Future Directions
Looking ahead, several avenues for future exploration and improvement exist:
- Incorporating domain-specific knowledge and additional features could enhance model performance and predictive accuracy.
- Experimenting with advanced ensemble techniques, such as stacking or blending, may lead to further improvements in prediction outcomes.
- Exploring alternative deep learning architectures, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks or Transformer models, could capture temporal dependencies and spatial patterns more effectively.
- Conducting sensitivity analysis and feature importance ranking could provide valuable insights into the underlying factors driving silica concentrate percentage, guiding feature selection and engineering efforts.
