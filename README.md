# Mining Industry AI Model for Predicting Silica Concentrate Percentage

## Introduction
In this project, we develop machine learning and deep learning models to predict the percentage of Silica Concentrate in the Iron ore concentrate per minute. This project aims to provide a faster and more efficient method compared to traditional lab measurements in the Mining Industry.

## Problem Statement
The traditional method of measuring the percentage of Silica Concentrate involves lab measurements, which can be time-consuming and inefficient for real-time decision making. Our goal is to predict the Silica Concentrate percentage accurately and quickly to enhance operational efficiency in mining facilities.

## Objective
Predict the percentage of Silica Concentrate in the Iron ore concentrate per minute using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical data on various parameters related to mining operations, including the percentage of Silica Concentrate in the Iron ore concentrate. By leveraging past data, we aim to build predictive models that can provide real-time predictions of Silica Concentrate percentage.

## Models Used
1. Linear Regression
2. Decision Tree Regressor
3. Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
4. XGBoost Regressor
